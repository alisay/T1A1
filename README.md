## 1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.	500 words

In 1980, the internet was owned by the American government. Commerce was forbidden and internet protocols developed with little regard to security due to the small and select nature of the community of users. The internet subsequently became public after being privatized in 1994-95. Today, the internet works by a system of rents and tolls not dissimilar to feudalism. 

When researching the history and development of the internet, we should ask ourselves to which internet we are referring. Do we mean all digital networks, or only those that implement internet protocols. If the latter, which protocols do we have in mind? There are a great many alternatives to 'our' internet - both historical alternatives and those which make up small components of the broader internet  (I mean the one I am connected to right now) and do not always operate in the same way as the whole. These include Fidonet, Usenet, BITNET, X.25, XNS, DECnet and CSNET (Dourish 2017). 

With this in mind, we could consider the moment when CSNET became operational, in 1981, as a first key event after 1980. While histories of the internet tend to emphasize its military roots through ARPANET, from an infrastructural point of view, CSNET has a reasonable claim to being the more significant progenitor of the contemporary internet. CSNET was developed in competition to ARPANET by universities (funded by the National Science Foundation) that were not conducting ARPA-sponsored research and thus were denied access to ARPANET. It was CSNET that later formed the backbone of NSFNET, which was eventually turned over to private industry in the moment that birthed the commercial internet. 

Technical protocols and standards nowadays are established by a self-selected oligarchy of scientists from an extremely homogenous social class (Zeb 2020a). For example, of the twenty-five or so original protocol pioneers, three of them (Vint Cerf, Jon Postel and Steve Crocker) all went to the same high school in Los Angeles’s San Fernando Valley (Galloway 2003). =4 ORGS OF THE INTERNET HERE=

A further key event in the development of the internet was the "Great Internet Sex Panic of 1995". 

A final key event (this is the fifth): in 2013, Edward Snowden revealed information showing the US National Security Agency and other federal equivalents were spying on internet users through access provided by phone companies, tech giants, tapping fibre optic cables, and circumventing encryption. Everyone continues to use the internet and seems totally fine with this, so perhaps it is the case that observation and surveillance are necessary in order for us to experience ourselves as real; "I am seen, therefore I am" (Frohne 2002).

###  - routers and routing
###   - domains and DNS

DNS stands for Domain Name System.  translate URLs into numerical IP addresses

## Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.	

### 3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 150 words each
  - TCP
  - HTTP and HTTPS
  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet	


## 4.	Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each. 100 words each.

In order for an algorithm to be operable, there is a prerequisite that structured data exist. Although we reason about these two things separately, one is useless without the other. "The distinction between the two is formal" (Goffey 2008). Data comes to be structured through a critical operation of translation: the transformation of things, actions or processes into information. This is always an abstraction. Humans are literally infected by abstractions (Whitehead 1938).

### Linked List

The kings of Mesopotamia regarded leaving a list inscribed on a tablet, after death, as insurance for an everlasting legacy. A list in Ruby is sequentially stored data, with each node containing a reference to the next piece of data. Lists provide an elegant data structure for representing information about the world in formal language, and thus for programming the operations involved in deduction (McCarthy 1996). This is the reasoning behind the heavy use of lists in the LISP programming language, the use of which is "the equivalent of communing with the old gods" (Zeb 2020b).

### Hash 

A hash is essentially a look-up table – a data structure dating back to the Ptolemaic dynasty, when trigonometric tables were first compiled for use by astronomers, navigators and builders. It is a mapping from a certain symbol (the look-up key) to a value associated with this key. One might use a hash of key-value pairs in cases where it is advantageous to precompute a function and save having to recalculate it later (with the argument vector as the key and the result as the value). The decision to do this would be based on an algorithmic trade-off between processing time and memory space (Babbage 1837).
 
### Binary Tree

"We're tired of trees... they've made us suffer too much," wrote Deleuze & Guattari in 1000 Plateaus (D&G 1980). A tree is a non-linear structure, where data branches from a root node. It can be used to store data that naturally forms a hierarchy. A binary tree has at most two children to each node. It allows for fast search, insert and delete on sorted data. Binary trees supply the precision, speed, unambiguity, continuity, discretion, unity, strict subordination, and reduction of friction that is essential to the entrenching of bureaucracy in contemporary society (Castelle 2013).




## 5. Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.

## 6 Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.	

Lisp?

## 7 Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue. 

## For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way.

## Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen. Discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches.	

The objective of this paper is to consider the practicability of the ethical model implied
by Karen Barad’s ethico-onto-epistemological theory. I wish to ask the question of
whether the idea of individual responsibility, which appears to constitute the backbone
of traditional ethics, can be reconciled with the new materialistic idea of the intra-activity
of matter, which calls human individualism and independency into question. According
to Karen Barad agency is the quality not limited to human actors only. No longer can
humans be perceived as independent beings capable of making autonomous choices,
because the non-human subjects actively influence their decisions. That said, human
behaviour cannot be reduced to a set of mechanical involuntary responses to external
factors (or internal ones for that matter, since plethora of different bacteria shape our
perception from within our bodies). When scrutinized through the lens of Barad’s
agential realism, the picture of personal responsibility becomes hazy: if ‘blame’ cannot
be justly attributed to either human or non-human actants, where else should it be
placed? Perhaps the validity of the very idea of blame, understood as the immediate
result of a free subject’s independent activity, should be questioned? Liberatory and
somewhat romantic, as the ideas of intra-activity as well as ‘intra-material community’,
where every form of existence matters, are, they do prompt one to ask the question of
their applicability to a human being’s conduct of everyday life.

## 8 Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language	

## 9 Explain type coercion

Type coercion in ruby means changing the data type of an object into another.

## 10 Describe the data types recognised by the Ruby programming language. In your description you should give example code which uses each data type, and include the name of the Ruby classes which represent each data type.	

## 11 Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”>
  - Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
  - Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified	

## 12 Identify and explain the error in the following code that is preventing correct execution of the program	

On the second line, the program is trying to manipulate a string as if it is a number. This error could be resolved by using the gets.to_i method on the first line to coerce the input from the user into an integer. 

## 13 The following code looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.	

 ```ruby
arr = [5, 22, 29, 39, 19, 51, 78, 96, 84]
n = arr.length
(n-1).times do |i|
    if arr[i] > arr[i+1]
    arr[i], arr[i + 1] = arr[i + 1], arr[i]
    end
end
```

    initially all set to true.
    
    for x = 2 ... 100 do
        if A[x] is true
            for y = x^2, x^2+x, x^2+2x, x^2+3x, ..., not exceeding 100 do

## 15 Weather advice

```ruby 
def weather(raining, temperature)
    result = case [raining, (temperature<15)]
    when [true, true] then puts "It’s wet and cold"
    when [true, false] then puts "It’s warm and raining"
    when [false, true] then puts "It’s not raining but cold"
    when [false, false] then puts "It’s warm but not raining"

    puts "You are allergic to the following:"
    allergies = ["eggs", "peanuts", "shellfish", "strawberries", "tomatoes", "chocolate", "pollen", "cats"]
    array = []
    while (score > 0)
        array.append(score%2)
        score = (score/2)
